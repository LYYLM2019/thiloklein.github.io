## Pre-course survey

This survey allows you to submit a preference ranking over group project topics. For details on the 10 games you can choose from, see the 'Games' column of the course timetable on the [course website](/teaching/games/index.html).

***

#### About

You can either submit your preferences individually or as a group. 

<b>Group submissions:</b> guarantee your group members. In this case, the form is to be filled in by ONE member on behalf of the other group member(s). Confirmation of successful submission will be emailed to ALL group members.

<b>Individual submissions:</b> will be matched with other students based on their preferences over project topics.

Assignments are the optimal solutions to the [Generalized assignment problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_assignment_problem). We will email each group with the assigned partners and project topic by 5th February.
