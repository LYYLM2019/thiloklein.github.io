This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
## Read chunk from tree.R (does not run code)
knitr::read_chunk('../3_R/tree.R')
```

```{r myTree, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis', cache=TRUE}
## Run code for chunk labeled myTree
```

Note that the use of the parameters in the code chunks

- `echo = FALSE` to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot
- `warning = FALSE` -- don't show R warnings
- `message = FALSE` -- don't show R messages
- `results = 'asis'` -- output as-is, i.e., write raw results from R into the output document
