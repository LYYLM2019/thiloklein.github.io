## Replication Lab

Joint course with [Paul Kattuman](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/research/faculty/kattumanp.html).

***

#### About

The objective of the replication lab is to build a community of applied econometrics researchers, through the hands-on and collaborative process of replicating interesting published research that uses econometric techniques, in the substantive areas of interest to the School.

For each research paper, an advanced PhD student takes the lead in clarifying the approach taken in analysis, and in gaining access to original data and eventually taking a lead in the session around replicating that paper.

The primary objective of the lab is the exact replication of published results. The secondary objective of the workshop is to discuss possible extensions of the paper. There is always hope that a student will identify a crucial error - as in the [recent case](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22223190) where Reinhart and Rogoff's results on economic growth and debt was overturned by the PhD student Thomas Herndon in a [replication study](http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf).
