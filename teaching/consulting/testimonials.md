"The Empirics Lab offers a fantastic service to students who need a little help with their statistics (and who doesn't!). The meeting with Thilo Klein helped me to think clearly and logically about what I needed to do with my data and offered an excellent supplementary set of advice to supervisors who are not always available. You need to book in advance sometimes, so plan ahead!" -- Joe Gladstone, MPhil in Innovation, Strategy, and Organisation, University of Cambridge, Cambridge/UK

"Advice at the empirics clinic was fantastic. I came with a set of questions on modeling and set-up of my research design, and left with a clear idea of the next steps. Help was precise, detailed and tailored exactly to what I needed. It was extremely helpful for my empirical PhD chapter to get support from the empirics clinic." -- Nicole Janz, Ph.D. Candidate, Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge, Cambridge/UK

"The sessions with Thilo Klein helped me to think about possible empirical pitfalls in my data I have not thought about before. The Empirics Clinic is an institution every leading university should offer in order to provide reliable and valid methodical research. The CJBS team's wide knowledge about various statistical techniques stands for the high quality of its Ph.D. programme." -- Christina Dietz, Ph.D. Candidate, Strategic Management, Free University of Berlin, Berlin/Germany

"I'm a visiting Ph.D. student at JBS. While I'm studying here, I'm conducting research on behavioral factors of new vendor decisions with limited demand information.

Thanks a lot :)" -- Zhao Yingshuai 赵英帅, Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing/China
