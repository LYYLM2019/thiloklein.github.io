## Market Design: Auctions and Matching


This is an introductory course in market design for Masters students with a focus on matching markets. In matching markets, supply and demand are often not exclusively coordinated by prices, but by other criteria. Prominent examples include personal preferences of market participants in the sharing economy, as well as in education and labour markets, where both sides have to choose each other, i.e. employees cannot just choose their employer, they also have to be chosen (and vice versa).
