## Research

My research interest is in market design. This economic discipline examines the reasons why markets institutions fail and considers the properties of alternative mechanisms. I seek to combine microeconomic theory and microeconometrical analysis to gain insights about the design of market rules and institutions.

#### Working papers

- [Does Anti-Diversification Pay? A One-Sided Matching Model of Microfinance](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cam/camdae/1521.html). Cambridge Working Papers in Economics \#1521, 2015.

  In many economic situations, market participation requires that agents form groups subject to exogenous rules. Consider a microfinance institution that decides on rules for diversifying borrower groups in terms of their exposure to income shocks. Such rules affect group repayment by influencing both who matches with whom (direct effect) and who participates in the market (participation). I develop the key trade-off for conflicting predictions of extant theoretical models and estimate both effects separately. Group formation creates an endogeneity problem, but a matching model exploits the exogenous variation from counterfactual groups. I find that while diversification has no participation effect it has a significant positive direct effect.

- [Analysis of stable matchings in R: Package matchingMarkets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matchingMarkets/vignettes/matching.pdf). Vignette to R package matchingMarkets, The Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2015.

  The `matchingMarkets` package contains `R` and `C++` code for the estimation of structural models that correct for the sample selection bias of observed outcomes in matching markets. Matching is concerned with who transacts with whom, and how. For example, who works at which job, which students go to which school, who forms a workgroup with whom, and so on. The empirical analysis of matching markets is naturally subject to sample selection problems.  If agents match assortatively on characteristics unobserved to the analyst but correlated with both the exogenous variable and the outcome of interest, regression estimates will generally be biased. The package further implements matching algorithms such as the deferred-acceptance algorithm for college admissions, the top-trading-cycles algorithm for house allocation and a partitioning linear program for the roommates problem.

- [Why Do India's Urban Poor Choose to Go Private? Health Policy Simulations in Slums of Hyderabad](mphil.pdf). Ibidem Press, 2012.

  It is well known that even the abjectly poor in developing countries show marked preferences for private services compared to public offerings. Past research has attributed these preferences to a lack of public provider accountability, which can be observed in terms of provider attitude, and the inavailability of even basic drugs in public health facilities. Stated preference research in bottom at the pyramid markets has shown that the availability of medicines is the predominant factor in hospital choice of the poor.  This paper disentangles consumer preferences for the certain and the uncertain components of expenses for medicines. In line with new theories of insurance demand, discrete choice experiments for maternity care in slums of Hyderabad show that those living below USD 2 per day have even more pronounced preferences for the insured provision of the uncertain component than higher income people.  This insurance demand is shown to be an important, and so far overlooked, factor that explains low income people's predilection for private providers, such as microfinance institutions.

  The [working paper](http://www.rug.nl/research/globalisation-studies-groningen/research/conferencesandseminars/conferences/eumicrofinconf2011/papers/4b.klein.pdf) is available in the Proceedings of the 2011 European Research Conference on Microfinance.

- [Microfinance 2.0 - Group Formation & Repayment Performance in Online Lending Platforms](diploma.pdf). Ibidem Press, 2010.

  Microfinance 2.0 examines the role of reputation-based intermediaries on the worldâ€™s largest peer-to-peer online lending platform. This marketplace as well as other recently opened lending websites allow people to auction microcredit over the Internet and are in line with the disintermediation in financial transactions through the power of enabling technologies. To mitigate severe information asymmetries in anonymous online transactions, the platforms allow lenders to delegate the screening of potential borrowers and the monitoring of loan repayments to designated group leaders. Thilo Klein provides an in-depth study into the mechanisms of these credit information networks and critically assesses their potential to ease access to finance for the credit-constrained during the US credit crunch.
